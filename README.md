# UX (User Experience)
___

## User Stories:
### 1. Users Goals

* The main goal in here is to let the users to  understand the main purpose of the site and learning more about the project.
* As the user I want to be able to navigate the site and to alocate all their **social media**, __links__ and  __inputs__ either they work really good or not.
* As the user I would like to see how really the app works if there are any extras added to make it unique like temperatures.

### Returning Users Goals:

* As a user I keep on checking to see if the weather app has got more functions to make it easier for anyone using it.
### Frequent User Goals
* As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added Icons of 3D format which makes the app look so good and real .
* As a Frequent user for the app I would like to check if the the app has got more links which are so helpful to the any user .So as if the app has got acculate time of and so fouth.
## Design Choices:
___

#### Icons
I used Font Awesome Icons in this project and are basically provided on this link [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) and are **easly applied** to your website, used in __moderation__ and are self explanatory as you will be seeing.

### Fonts:
For this project I'm going to use Sans Serif and JP [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather) however I found this would be a great much the project .

### Colors:
1. I have sofar picked up four types of colors, and in my understanding they will make the weather app project look quiet pretty and in appearance looks promising.
2. These are the colors am gonna use in my project.

These are the main colours that am gonna use in this weather project.

* For body text and some titles: White #ffffff;
* For the the background image: Oxford Blue #14213D;
* For the border and social media background: Ochre #B67102;
* For the font Icons the background-color: Black  #000000;

## Wireframes:
For my wireframing i used apen Prototyping. I found this was really easy for me to use. And it helped me to play around with  whatever i wanted and to see how it is on different screen sizes.
To be more clear of what i did, here are explanations about my wireframes.

## Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

  * The userb also has got an option of typing in the search bar for knowing the weather forecast of the day and also easily to navigate throughout the site by going down to the footer section.
### Returning Users Goals:

  * At the bottom of every page their is a footer which content is consistent is at the bottom of the pages. 

## Bugs:
___
I had alot of bugs in the search box where when ever i could search for the place or a country yes it could run good but it could not display the time, date, month and the year.
Another bug was the temperature could not round off to math giving out the results with a decimal point.
I came across this bug by making some changes in my JavaSCRIPT code. Where by the conditon on line 10 had made it true in other i had coded it wrongly making it evt.key by not calling evt.keyCode to make it true to run.
and later to put it in console.log. So it could run good.
I came across alot of bugs in trying to make the uri to work , mostly I was getting undefined 404  and addEventListener not declared so then I had to consult my mentor.
where I got most of my help and also following the videos from code institute.
